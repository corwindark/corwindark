## Welcome to my Github!

My name is Corwin Dark. I am currently in the second year of the Data Science Master's program at Georgetown, where my projects have centered on using data science for financial markets and organizational strategy. I spent last summer in the Capital Markets Tradng Desk at the New York Fed, where I built out a data pipeline and dashboard that collected key metrics for traders and analysts to review with regard to emerging market economies.

This semester, I'm currently working on:
- My Masters capstone project: Using graph neural networks to simulate atomistic environments
- Predicting retail investor trading activity via NLP of Reddit comments, scaling up a past analysis from 50,000 comments to 3 million
- A new block-placement system for one of my Roblox games

If you want to revew what I can do, here are quick links to some of my projects:
- Keras neural networks and statistical forecasting: My project integrating ANNs into statistcal ensembles for financial time series prediction
- Data visualization: An interactive story coded in Javascript on climate change in Bridges National Monument
- R and Shiny web applications: A tool to rebalance my ETF portfolio automatically

Also, for fun, I have personal projects:
- My Roblox games
- My technical Minecraft channel
