## Welcome to my Github!

My name is Corwin Dark. I am currently in the second year of the Data Science Master's program at Georgetown, where my projects have centered on using data science for financial markets and organizational strategy. I spent last summer in the Capital Markets Trading Desk at the New York Fed, where I built out a data pipeline and dashboard that collected key metrics for traders and analysts to review with regard to emerging market economies.

This semester, I'm currently working on:
- My Masters capstone project: Building a Python package that can simulate atom-scale environments more efficiently than current methods, implemented with Pytorch tensors.
- Predicting retail investor trading activity via NLP of Reddit comments, scaling up a past analysis from 50,000 comments to as many as 700 million, using a PySpark cluster in AWS
- Netcode for a mobile turn-based strategy game I am developing
